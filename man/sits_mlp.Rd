\arguments{
\item{samples}{Time series with the training samples.}

\item{samples_validation}{Time series with the validation samples. if the
\code{samples_validation} parameter is provided,
the \code{validation_split} parameter is ignored.}

\item{layers}{Vector with number of hidden nodes in each layer.}

\item{dropout_rates}{Vector with the dropout rates (0,1)
for each layer.}

\item{optimizer}{Optimizer function to be used.}

\item{opt_hparams}{Hyperparameters for optimizer:
lr : Learning rate of the optimizer
eps: Term added to the denominator
     to improve numerical stability..
weight_decay:       L2 regularization}

\item{epochs}{Number of iterations to train the model.}

\item{batch_size}{Number of samples per gradient update.}

\item{validation_split}{Number between 0 and 1.
Fraction of the training data for validation.
The model will set apart this fraction
and will evaluate the loss and any model metrics
on this data at the end of each epoch.}

\item{patience}{Number of epochs without improvements until
training stops.}

\item{min_delta}{Minimum improvement in loss function
to reset the patience counter.}

\item{verbose}{Verbosity mode (TRUE/FALSE). Default is FALSE.}
}
\value{
A torch mlp model to be used for classification.
}
\description{
Use a multi-layer perceptron algorithm to classify data.
This function uses the R "torch" and "luz" packages.
Please refer to the documentation of those package for more details.
}
\note{
The parameters for the MLP have been chosen based on the work by
Wang et al. 2017
that takes multilayer perceptrons as the baseline for time series
classifications:
(a) Three layers with 512 neurons each, specified by the parameter `layers`;
(b) dropout rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% for the layers;
(c) the "optimizer_adam" as optimizer (default value);
(d) a number of training steps (`epochs`) of 100;
(e) a `batch_size` of 64, which indicates how many time series
are used for input at a given steps;
(f) a validation percentage of 20%, which means 20% of the samples
will be randomly set side for validation.
(g) The "relu" activation function.
