\title{Find temporal patterns associated to a set of time series}
\usage{
sits_patterns(data = NULL, freq = 8, formula = y ~ s(x), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Time series.}

\item{freq}{Interval in days for estimates.}

\item{formula}{Formula to be applied in the estimate.}

\item{...}{Any additional parameters.}
}
\value{
Time series with patterns.
}
\description{
This function takes a set of time series samples as input
estimates a set of patterns. The patterns are calculated using a GAM model.
The idea is to use a formula of type y ~ s(x), where x is a temporal
reference and y if the value of the signal. For each time, there will
be as many predictions as there are sample values.
The GAM model predicts a suitable
approximation that fits the assumptions of the statistical model,
based on a smooth function.

This method is based on the "createPatterns" method of the dtwSat package,
which is also described in the reference paper.
