\title{Cleans the samples based on SOM map information}
\usage{
sits_som_clean_samples(
  som_map,
  prior_threshold = 0.6,
  posterior_threshold = 0.6,
  keep = c("clean", "analyze")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{som_map}{Object returned by \code{\link[sits]{sits_som_map}}.}

\item{prior_threshold}{Threshold of conditional probability
(frequency of samples assigned to the same SOM neuron).}

\item{posterior_threshold}{Threshold of posterior probability
(influenced by the SOM neighborhood).}

\item{keep}{Which types of evaluation to be maintained in the data.}
}
\value{
tibble with an two additional columns.
The first indicates if each sample is clean, should be analyzed or
should be removed. The second is the posterior probability of the sample.
