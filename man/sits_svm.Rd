\description{
This function receives a tibble with a set of attributes X
for each observation Y. These attributes are the values of the time series
for each band.
The SVM algorithm is used for multiclass-classification.
For this purpose, it uses the "one-against-one" approach,
in which k(k-1)/2 binary classifiers are trained;
the appropriate class is found by a voting scheme.
This function is a front-end to the "svm" method in the "e1071" package.
Please refer to the documentation in that package for more details.
