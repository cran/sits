# WorldCover - ESA 10 meter map

# (10)	Tree cover	LCCS - A12A3 // A11A1 A24A3C1(C2)- R1(R2)
#       This class includes any geographic area dominated by trees with a cover
#       of 10% or more. Other land cover classes (shrubs and/or herbs in the
#       understorey, built-up, permanent water bodies, …) can be present
#       below the canopy, even with a density higher than trees. Areas planted
#       with trees for afforestation purposes and plantations (e.g. oil palm,
#       olive trees) are included in this class. This class also includes tree
#       covered areas seasonally or permanently flooded with
#       fresh water except for mangroves.
# (20)	Shrubland	LCCS - A12A4 // A11A2
#    	This class includes any geographic area dominated by natural shrubs
#    	having a cover of 10% or more. Shrubs are defined as woody perennial
#    	plants with persistent and woody stems and without any defined main
#    	stem being less than 5 m tall. Trees can be present in scattered form
#    	if their cover is less than 10%. Herbaceous plants can also be present
#    	at any density. The shrub foliage can be either
#    	evergreen or deciduous.
# (30)	Grassland	LCCS- A12A2
#       This class includes any geographic area dominated by natural
#       herbaceous plants (Plants without persistent stem or shoots above
#       ground and lacking definite firm structure): (grasslands, prairies,
#       steppes, savannahs, pastures) with a cover of 10% or more,
#       irrespective of different human and/or animal activities,
#       such as: grazing, selective fire management etc.
#       Woody plants (trees and/or shrubs) can be present assuming their
#       cover is less than 10%. It may also contain uncultivated c
#       ropland areas (without harvest/ bare soil period) in the reference year.
# (40)	Cropland	LCCS - A11A3(A4)(A5) // A23
#       Land covered with annual cropland that is sowed/planted and harvestable
#       at least once within the 12 months after the sowing/planting date.
#       The annual cropland produces an herbaceous cover and is sometimes
#       combined with some tree or woody vegetation.
#       Note that perennial woody crops will be classified as the appropriate
#       tree cover or shrub land cover type. Greenhouses are
#       considered as built-up.
# (50)	Built-up	LCCS - B15A1	Land covered by buildings, roads and
#       other man-made structures such as railroads. Buildings include both
#       residential and industrial building. Urban green (parks,
#       sport facilities) is not included in this class. Waste dump deposits
#       and extraction sites are considered as bare.
# (60)	Bare / sparse vegetation	LCCS - B16A1(A2) // B15A2
#       Lands with exposed soil, sand, or rocks and never has more than 10%
#       vegetated cover during any time of the year
# (70)	Snow and Ice	LCCS - B28A2(A3)
#       This class includes any geographic area covered by
#       snow or glaciers persistently
# (80)	Permanent water bodies	LCCS - B28A1(B1) // B27A1(B1)
#       This class includes any geographic area covered for most of the year
#       (more than 9 months) by water bodies: lakes, reservoirs, and rivers.
#       Can be either fresh or salt-water bodies. In some cases the water
#       can be frozen for part of the year (less than 9 months).
# (90)	Herbaceous wetland	LCCS - A24A2	Land dominated by natural herbaceous
#       vegetation (cover of 10% or more) that is permanently or regularly
#       flooded by fresh, brackish or salt water.
#       It excludes unvegetated sediment (see 60), swamp forests (classified as
#       tree cover) and mangroves.
# (95)	Mangroves	LCCS - A24A3C5-R3	Taxonomically diverse,
#       salt-tolerant tree and other plant species which thrive in
#       intertidal zones of sheltered tropical shores,
#       "overwash" islands, and estuaries.
# (100)	Moss and lichen	LCCS - A12A7	Land covered with lichens and/or mosses.
#       Lichens are composite organisms formed from the symbiotic association
#       of fungi and algae. Mosses contain photo-autotrophic land plants without
#       true leaves, stems, roots but with leaf-and stemlike organs.
